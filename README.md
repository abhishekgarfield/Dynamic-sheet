## âœ… Assignment Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Requirements (Initial Task)

1. **Main Screen Layout**

   - Display a vertical list of **8â€“9 cards** with dummy data (title and short description).
   - Display a horizontal list of **7â€“8 demo cards** (e.g., trending or recent items).
   - On tapping any vertical card, a **BottomSheet** opens with a detailed description of that card.

2. **BottomSheet Behavior**
   - Height should **match the height of its content** dynamically.
   - If content is **less than screen height**, open only up to the content height.
   - If content is **more than screen height**, open to a default height (e.g., **70â€“80%**), and:
     - Be **draggable** to expand or collapse.
